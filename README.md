# express-mongoose
Hi all this is just a demo of express and mongoose I have added a structured way to develop API's in server-side
I have added multi routing, auth with JWT, model structure and data operation with mongoose, use of .env file and general constant management's and add/edit/list(with sorting, pagination, and search)
all of that with how to use the power of commenting your code which makes it easy for others to use our code
